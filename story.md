# Codable - Project Story

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Codable came from our own experiences as developers struggling with code analysis, debugging, and learning new programming concepts. We noticed that while AI tools were becoming more powerful, there wasn't a comprehensive platform that combined intelligent code analysis, visual learning aids, and personalized progress tracking in one seamless experience.

We were particularly inspired by:
- The frustration of spending hours debugging code that could be analyzed instantly by AI
- The lack of visual tools to understand complex code logic and flow
- The need for a gamified learning experience that keeps developers motivated
- The potential of combining multiple AI providers (Gemini 2.0 Flash and CopilotKit) for enhanced capabilities
- The desire to create a platform that grows with developers, from beginners to experts

Our vision was to build more than just another code analysis tool - we wanted to create an intelligent coding companion that understands, teaches, and evolves with each developer's journey.
